Tetris with Raspberry Sense Hat LED matrix

## TODO
0. Fix clearRows(). Other cells may fall down after a row has been deleted
1. Change representation of pieces in order to make Matrix class do checks. Otherwise the pieces need game_matrix
   and this is heavy coupled
2. Add rotation capabilities
3. Extend to different pieces at different starting positions
